      <h2>Home Page: Introduction to Robotics and Its Applications</h2>
      <p>
        Robotics is an interdisciplinary field that merges engineering, computer
        science, and technology to create machines capable of performing various
        tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously. These robots are often
        programmed to perform specific tasks, such as assembling products on a
        factory line, assisting in surgeries, or even exploring distant planets.
        Robotics has opened new possibilities for industries, healthcare,
        exploration, and personal use, leading to innovation in sectors that
        previously relied heavily on manual labor.
      </p>

      <p>
        In recent years, advancements in artificial intelligence, machine
        learning, and sensor technologies have greatly enhanced the capabilities
        of robots. They are no longer just machines following preset
        instructions, but autonomous systems capable of learning, adapting, and
        interacting with their environment. From robotic arms in manufacturing
        to drones in agriculture, the world of robotics is rapidly evolving and
        has become a critical part of modern society.

      <h2>Robots in Industry: Key Advancements in Industrial Automation</h2>
      <p>
        Robots are revolutionizing industrial sectors by automating processes
        that previously required human labor. The most common types of
        industrial robots include robotic arms, which are widely used in the
        automotive, electronics, and consumer goods industries. These machines
        can perform tasks with precision, speed, and endurance beyond human
        capabilities, such as welding, painting, assembling, and packaging.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition to reducing production time and costs, industrial robots can
        work in hazardous environments where human safety might be at risk, such
        as in handling toxic materials or working in extreme temperatures. As
        the demand for mass production grows, robots are becoming essential for
        maintaining the pace and quality required in modern manufacturing. The
        future of industrial robots includes increased collaboration between
        robots and humans, with robots assisting workers in complex tasks that
        require high-level decision-making.

      <h2>
        Humanoid Robots: Overview of Humanoid Robots and Their Capabilities
      </h2>
      <p>
        Humanoid robots are robots designed to resemble and mimic human
        behavior, both in appearance and functionality. These robots are capable
        of performing tasks traditionally reserved for humans, such as assisting
        in healthcare, customer service, and education. The defining
        characteristic of humanoid robots is their ability to interact with
        humans in a natural and intuitive way, using advanced algorithms for
        speech recognition, facial expression interpretation, and
        decision-making.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some of the most well-known humanoid robots include robots like ASIMO,
        Sophia, and Atlas, which have been designed for various purposes, from
        assisting the elderly and disabled to performing dangerous tasks in
        disaster-stricken areas. Humanoid robots are also becoming an integral
        part of research and development, where they help scientists better
        understand human cognition, biomechanics, and social interaction. With
        continued advancements in artificial intelligence and robotics, humanoid
        robots are expected to become more autonomous, capable of learning from
        experience, and performing increasingly complex tasks in the future.
