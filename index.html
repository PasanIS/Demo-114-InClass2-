        Robotics is an interdisciplinary field that merges engineering, computer
        science, and technology to create machines capable of performing various
        tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously. These robots are often
        programmed to perform specific tasks, such as assembling products on a
        factory line, assisting in surgeries, or even exploring distant planets.
        Robotics has opened new possibilities for industries, healthcare,
        exploration, and personal use, leading to innovation in sectors that
        previously relied heavily on manual labor.

        In recent years, advancements in artificial intelligence, machine
        learning, and sensor technologies have greatly enhanced the capabilities
        of robots. They are no longer just machines following preset
        instructions, but autonomous systems capable of learning, adapting, and
        interacting with their environment. From robotic arms in manufacturing
        to drones in agriculture, the world of robotics is rapidly evolving and
        has become a critical part of modern society.
